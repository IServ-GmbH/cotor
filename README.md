# Composer Tools Installer aka Cotor

## How to use cotor

You can install any composer based dev tool with cotor. It will install each package in a `tools` folder in your current working directory.
For each tool a standalone folder named by the package without the vendor will be created.

### Commands

* **install**: Installs all tools listed in your composer.json at `extra.cotor`.
* **install $name**: Install a new tool. `$name` must be a tool's composer or registered shortcut name.
* **update $name**: Updates an installed tool. `$name` must be a tool's name without vendor or registered shortcut name.
* **update-all**: Updates all installed tools.

## How to build cotor

1. Ensure you've got `box` installed in your `$PATH`.
2. Run `box compile` to create a new `cotor.phar`.

`box` takes the latest git tag or hash to propagate this as the PHARs version. So be sure to hava a proper git history before running the command.
